# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) Simply uses useState and useEffect to immediately render a list of pokemon objects through an API. This project utilizes axios library. Hope to revisit this project to do something with it.
